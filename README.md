# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project focused on distinguishing between rocks and mines using a Linear Regression model.
# Overview
The precise categorization of submerged entities such as rocks and mines holds significant importance for a range of purposes, including naval safeguarding and ecological surveillance. In this endeavor, we harness the potential of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning methodology, to address this classification predicament.
# Key Features:

# Data Preprocessing: 
We offer a comprehensive range of data preprocessing scripts that effectively cleanse and prepare datasets for modeling purposes. This encompasses essential tasks such as data normalization, feature engineering, and proficient handling of missing values.

# Linear Regression Model: 
We employ a Linear Regression model for the purpose of binary classification. Despite its inherent simplicity, Linear Regression has the potential to yield remarkable results when appropriately configured and applied to a suitable problem domain.

# Evaluation Metrics: 
The model's performance is evaluated through the utilization of diverse evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This enables us to effectively measure the model's ability to differentiate between rocks and mines.

# Visualization: 
We offer data visualization tools to help users gain insights into the dataset and model performance. Visualizations include scatter plots, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

# Cross-Validation: 
To ensure the model's generalizability, we employ k-fold cross-validation to estimate its performance on unseen data.

# Deployment: 
While this repository primarily focuses on model development, we provide guidance on how to deploy the model in real-world scenarios.
