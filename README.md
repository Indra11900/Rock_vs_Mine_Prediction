# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project focused on distinguishing between rocks and mines using a Linear Regression model.
# Overview
The precise categorization of submerged entities such as rocks and mines holds significant importance for a range of purposes, including naval safeguarding and ecological surveillance. In this endeavor, we harness the potential of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning methodology, to address this classification predicament.
